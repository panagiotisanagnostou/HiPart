Divisive Clustering and Visualization
=====================================

Herein is an example of the recent HiPart library for divisive
clustering (Anagnostou et al. (2022)). In this tutorial, we will perform
divisive clustering through one of the methods provided by the library,
and we will examine it’s static visualizations options. There is an
interactive plot tool provided by the package as well, but we will not
cover it here. Initially we load the required libraries for this
example, mainly the sklearn datasets and matplotlib for ploting.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: python

      # install HiPart using pip
      # %pip install HiPart

      import numpy as np
      import pandas as pd
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

      from HiPart.clustering import dePDDP
      from HiPart import visualizations as hvs

      from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
      from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
      from sklearn.datasets import load_linnerud

The iris example
================

For consistency (and historical reasons :) ) we start with an example on
clustering the iris dataset. The algorithm of choice here is dePDDP
because it provides efficient density clustering and its
parameterization unveils interesting aspects (S. K. Tasoulis, Tasoulis,
and Plagianakos (2010)). The actual number of clusters is given (3),
along with a “bandwidth” parameter that affects the sensitivity of the
kernel density estimation, similarly to the bin_size parameter we
usually provide to histograms. The basic attribute of this algorithm is
that it clusters the data based on such one dimensional density
estimations. Since, the clustering is **divisive** the algorithm
generate binary splits thus, in contrast to other clustering methods, it
is straight forward to define parameters such as the smallest size of
cluster allowed, and how uneven should the resulting subclusters be.
These are controlled by the “min_sample_split” and “percentile”
parameters respectively.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: python

      data = load_iris()
      Y = data.target
      X = data.data 

      clustered_class = dePDDP(max_clusters_number=3, bandwidth_scale=0.5, percentile=0.2, min_sample_split=5)

      clu_res = clustered_class.fit(X)

      # clu_res.output_matrix
      m = hvs.split_visualization(clu_res)

         Divisive Clustering Example for 3 clusters

Notice:

-  The output_matrix output:

It can be very useful to get the whole tree structure in the form of a
matrix. Each row represents a data point and each column cluster ids
(predicted labels). More precisely each column contain the clustering
ids to a corresponding iterative step of the clustering procedure, so
the first column contains the clustering ids for a binary split, then
the second the ids after the second break (cluster ids for three
clusters) and the last column the final cluster ids according to the
desired number of cluster given to the algorithm as input.

-  Lets change the desired number of clusters

The dePDDP algorithm is deterministic. In practice this means than when
we rerun the algorithm “allowing” it to retrieve a higher number of
clusters we just relax the stopping criterion. The algorithm will choose
to split further a leaf node from the previous clustering result.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: python

      clustered_class = dePDDP(max_clusters_number=5, bandwidth_scale=0.5, percentile=0.2, min_sample_split=5)

      clu_res = clustered_class.fit(X)
      m = hvs.split_visualization(clu_res)

Simplicity, Sensitivity
=======================

Setting up the parameters for dePDDP is super simple to understand but
can be tricky as well. In practice, there are two dominant parameters
that need to be specified carefully since they interact. For example the
“number of clusters” parameter can be skipped completely. This will also
allow us to use the algorithm for cluster number estimation. However,
the bandwidth selection for the kernel density estimation could greatly
affect the results in this case.

In the following example, we only set the “bandwidth_scale” parameter
and the algorithm estimate the number of clusters itself. We plot the
results along with the “true labels”. We observe that two clusters have
great scale of overlap constituting in practice one cluster with double
the size. The algorithm identifies it as one cluster and provides a
reasonable estimate for the number of cluster in this example.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: python

      X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1500, centers=6, random_state=0)

      clustered_class = dePDDP(bandwidth_scale=1.5)

      # get only the predicted class
      clu_res = clustered_class.fit_predict(X)

      fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, constrained_layout=True, sharey=True)
      ax1.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=y, alpha=0.5)
      ax1.set_title('True Labels')
      ax2.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=clu_res, alpha=0.5)
      ax2.set_title('Clustering result')

Dendrogram example
==================

Yay, we can also plot dendrograms! Remember that divisive clustering
operates in a top down fashion. The orange cluster has been split from
the rest of the dataset first. Although there are no cluster similaries
estimated here, we may assume that the green and red clusters are more
similar to each other because they have been split later in the
iterative procedure.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: python

      data = load_linnerud()
      Y = data.target
      X = data.data 

      clustered_class = dePDDP(max_clusters_number=3, bandwidth_scale=0.5, percentile=0.1, min_sample_split=1)

      clu_res = clustered_class.fit(X)
      m = hvs.dendrogram_visualization(clu_res)

Why bother?
===========

-  Speed and efficiency comparison

In this example we will test HiPart for high dimensional data to expose
the computational advantages of divisive over agglomerative clustering.
We employ the super simple iPDDP algorithm (S. Tasoulis and Tasoulis
(2008)) as we expect extensive data sparsity and a minimal deegre of
cluster overlap, so the distance based clustering criterio seems more
appropriate than the density one. We also use a dataset with uneven
clusters to make the comparison more interesting.
