def split_visualization(hipart_object, color_map="tab20"):
    """
    Create the visualization of each of the splits generated by one of the
    divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms, members of HiPart package.
    For each split, we visualize the data on the first two principal
    components, while the color of each sample is chosen depending on the
    cluster it belongs to. The colors throughout the separate split represent
    the same cluster each time.

    Depending on the input object, the visualization is enriched with
    additional information related to the algorithm that created it. For the:

    1. dePDDP object, the visualization adds a marginal plot on the X-axis that
    represents the density of the data as extracted from the kernel density
    estimation for the first principal component. That is the information the
    dePDDP algorithm utilizes to split each cluster.

    2. kM_PDDP object, the visualization adds a marginal plot on the X-axis
    that represents the data as they are projected on the first principal
    component, with the addition of the centers the k-Means finds within its
    execution on each split. That is the information the kM_PDDP algorithm
    utilizes to split each cluster.

    3. iPDDP along with PDDP objects, the visualization adds a marginal plot on
    the X-axis that represents the data as they are projected on the first
    principal component. That is the information the iPDDP algorithm utilizes
    to split each cluster.

    4. bicecting_kmeans object does not include additional information in the
    visualization. That is because of the nature of the algorithm it
    implements.

    Finally, for all the objects the visualization adds the selected split
    point for each split by each algorithm. This way one can validate the
    execution and the results of each algorithm. Moreover, examining this
    visualization can help the parametrization of the algorithms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hipart_object : dePDDP or iPDDP or kM_PDDP or PDDP or bicecting_kmeans
        The object member of HiPart package that we want to manipulate on the
        premiss of this function.
    color_map : string
        The name of the matplotlib color map to be used for the data
        visualization.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the hipart_object is not a member of the HiPart package raise an
        error for the possibility of unexpected errors that will be raised
        if the elements of the object are not correctly structured.
    ValueError
        If the "visualization_utility" attribute of the imported object is
        False, this causes some of the needed for this visualization data not
        to be created.

    Returns
    -------
    plt : pyplot (module)
        The created visulization by this function.

        All the parameters the scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram function can

        "color_threshold" parameter. This parameter takes a default threshold
